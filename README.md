# Principles

## Principle of using principles

- principles contradict each other

## Base principles

### Minimalism - use as less fetuses of the language/library/etc as possible

* use defaul OS/editor/etc apps and setup without customizations

### Loose Coupling and High Cohesion

Cohesion in software engineering is the degree to which the elements of a certain module belong together. 

If a change in one module results in many changes in another module then they are said to be highly coupled.

[SO](https://stackoverflow.com/q/14000762/805266)

### Explicit is Better Than Implicit

### Don't fix what isn't broken

[c2](http://wiki.c2.com/?IfItIsWorkingDontChange)

### Minimal sample (to reproduce error or demo feature)


## Anti patterns

### https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cargo_cult_programming

### Everything is hardcoded and everything is parametrized by everything

Too bad or too good coupling respectively

### God Object

High cohesion - a lot of unrelated functionality jumbled together

[wiki](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/God_object) [c2](http://wiki.c2.com/?GodClass)

### Overengineering and Underengineering

During unengineering, all principles are violated. With overengineering, all principles are brought to the point of absurdity.


### Growing programs

anti-planing. Adding new features into empty or sample project step by step if needed
  without further planing of system evolution (architecture, features, etc) and building proper backbones of the system.
  Such code contains of workarounds and hacks.

### It does work!

### Pyramid of Doom

Nested callbacks:

```js
f.foreach(function (g) {
   g.foreach(function (h) {
      h.filter(...
```

### NIH - Not Invented Here

- re-implementation of the library function
- re-implementation of functionality already available in the project
- using a bad knee algorithm instead of an existing good one (re-invent a wheel)

### Duplicate Code vs Compressed Code

[wiki](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Duplicate_code)

### Code Rot

[wiki](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_rot)

### Technical Debt

- the implied cost of additional rework caused by choosing an easy solution now instead of using a better approach that would take longer

### Code Smell

- any characteristic in the source code of a program that possibly indicates a deeper problem

#### Data Clump

- any group of variables which are passed around together (in a clump) throughout various parts of the program

## Behavioral and methodological anti-patterns

### Programming by analogy

- google a similar solution on SO and fix it
- copy a similar piece from another place in the current project and fix it

### Helpless kitten

- developer does not know what he is doing and afraids everything
  He does not evolve because of lack of intellect or absence of environmental pressure (project or team interest, market needs, etc)

## Source control principles

- A single standard for naming commits
- One commit = one task, in particular:
   - separating unrelated changes into different commits
   - separation of refactorings and reformattings and semantic changes
- Single repo instead of multiple ones to track contract changes across system nodes

## Testing

* Protection against regressions
* Resistance to refactoring
* Fast feedback
* Maintainability
* AAA

### Black box vs white box testing

### Integration tests

### Regression tests 

### TDD Ð¸ Tests First

- Arrange Act Assert (Given When Then)
- obj.verify(o => o.fun(args)).ones()

### Stubs and Mock Objects

### Randomized Property Testing

### BDD

- specflow
- [link](https://hiptest.com/blog/hiptest/getting-started-with-bdd-part-1/)

## Maintainence

- to replace the wrong with the right when a problem is detected is not our method. All dependencies that you use - you maintain them in fact. The result is more confidence in tools, and more confidence in coding, and more skill in dealing with problems.
- Shortening feedback loops is the most reliable way to improve any process. Identify which loop is the bottleneck, unclog it, rinse, repeat.
