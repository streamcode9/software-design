* automatization (e2e tests for critical pathes, linter, static analysis)
* form a list of conventions forming some guidelines and a set of automated checks to verify those conventions are not broken
* decisions log (ADR architecture decision record) - always know why something has happened
* limit the number of cross-context dependencies
* checklists (how to add a feature)
* document all different ways you can add a new feature
  * limit the number of ways you can do that
  * ideally - having as few options as possible, every feature should be similar technically to others
* visibility = diagrams
  * Infrastructure map (how data flows through services/servers/network and how it scales)
  * Architectural layers map (what subsystems you have for storing/transforming data)
  * Bounded contexts (how your logical services are split and mapped to architecture)
  * Main use cases dataflows (CRUD operations, data streaming/pushes, auth, payments)
